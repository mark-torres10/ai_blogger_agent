## Daily Standup Questions
1. What did you complete yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. Do you need help with anything?

## Blockers and Dependencies
- **Critical Path**: ABA-1 → ABA-3/4/6/7 → ABA-5/8 → ABA-9 → ABA-10 → ABA-11 → ABA-12/13/14
- **Current Blocker**: None (ABA-1 ready to start)
- **Next Blocker**: ABA-1 completion (blocks 4 parallel tickets)

## Notes
- Focus on ABA-1 completion first - it's the critical path
- After ABA-1, 4 tickets can be worked in parallel
- All tickets follow rapid prototyper guidelines for speed
- Use free tier services (Vercel/Railway) for deployment
