# Reflection: Project Scaffolding & Secure Configuration (temp01_001)

## Planning Reflection (2025-01-11)

### Task Breakdown Analysis
- **Approach**: Decomposed PR 1 into 8 granular subtasks with clear dependencies
- **Strengths**: Each subtask has single responsibility, clear deliverables, and realistic effort estimates
- **Considerations**: Critical path identified (Poetry → Dependencies → Directory → Config → Tests)

### Dependency Mapping
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Poetry initialization must come first, followed by directory creation
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Environment example, gitignore, and README can be done in parallel
- **Risk Assessment**: Low technical risk due to well-established patterns

### Effort Estimation Rationale
- **Poetry Setup**: 1 hour (straightforward project initialization)
- **Dependencies**: 1 hour (adding known packages to pyproject.toml)
- **Directory Structure**: 0.5 hours (simple folder creation)
- **Configuration Module**: 2 hours (Pydantic Settings class with validation)
- **Environment Example**: 0.5 hours (template creation)
- **Gitignore Update**: 0.5 hours (adding .env entry)
- **README**: 1 hour (setup instructions and documentation)
- **Unit Tests**: 2 hours (comprehensive testing of config module)

### Priority Scoring Logic
- **High Priority (5)**: Foundational tasks that block everything else
- **Medium Priority (4)**: Core functionality that depends on foundations
- **Lower Priority (3)**: Documentation and examples that can be done later

### Next Steps
1. Create Linear project in MET team
2. Generate Linear issues for each subtask
3. Update planning files with Linear IDs
4. Begin implementation

### Process Observations
- Task planning guidelines provided clear structure for decomposition
- Linear integration pending - need to establish MCP connection
- Ready to proceed with implementation once Linear setup is complete
