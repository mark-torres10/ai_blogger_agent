# AI Content Creation Agent System - Brain Dump

## Project Vision
Build an AI agent system that can generate blog post drafts and content summaries in Mark Torres's writing style, reducing content creation time while maintaining authenticity and quality.

## MVP Scope (Two-Part Approach)

### Part 1: Simple Topic-to-Article Generator
- **Input**: Text box where user enters a topic
- **Output**: Two-paragraph article in Mark's voice about that topic
- **Technology**: TypeScript-based web application
- **UI**: Simple, clean interface with text input and article display
- **Purpose**: Proof of concept for voice replication

### Part 2: Style Analysis and Guide Creation
- **Input**: Mark's existing blog content from three sections:
  - Research: https://markptorres.com/research/
  - Self Education: https://markptorres.com/self_education/
  - Personal: https://markptorres.com/personal/
- **Process**: 
  1. Analyze each article and create markdown files with:
     - Article link
     - Keywords
     - One-paragraph summary
     - Key style notes
  2. Synthesize all notes into comprehensive style guide
- **Output**: Replicable style guide for AI agents

## Key Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- **Language**: TypeScript (as specified)
- **Team**: AI blogger team in Linear
- **Environment**: No conda environment needed
- **Deployment**: Likely web-based for easy access
- **API Integration**: OpenAI or similar for content generation

### Content Requirements
- **Voice Consistency**: Must match Mark's authentic writing style
- **Quality**: High-quality, engaging content
- **Length**: Two paragraphs for MVP (expandable)
- **Topics**: Should handle various subjects (tech, research, personal)

### User Experience
- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interface
- **Speed**: Quick generation of content
- **Review Process**: Easy to edit/refine generated content
- **Accessibility**: Easy to use for non-technical users

## Questions to Address

### Technical Questions
1. What TypeScript framework should we use? (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
2. Where should we deploy this? (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
3. Which AI service should we use for content generation?
4. How should we handle API rate limits and costs?
5. What's the authentication strategy (if any)?

### Content Questions
1. How do we ensure the AI captures Mark's unique voice?
2. What topics should the system be able to handle?
3. How do we handle controversial or sensitive topics?
4. What's the review/approval process for generated content?
5. How do we measure success of voice replication?

### Style Analysis Questions
1. How many articles should we analyze for the style guide?
2. What specific style elements should we focus on?
3. How do we structure the style guide for AI consumption?
4. Should we include examples in the style guide?
5. How do we validate the style guide works?

## Potential Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **API Costs**: Managing AI service usage and costs
- **Rate Limiting**: Handling API limits gracefully
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring consistent output quality
- **Scalability**: Planning for future feature expansion

### Content Challenges
- **Voice Replication**: Accurately capturing Mark's writing style
- **Topic Breadth**: Handling diverse subjects effectively
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintaining high content standards
- **Originality**: Avoiding plagiarism while maintaining style

### Process Challenges
- **Style Analysis**: Thoroughly analyzing writing patterns
- **Guide Creation**: Creating comprehensive, actionable style guide
- **Validation**: Testing the style guide effectiveness
- **Iteration**: Refining based on feedback

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success
- Generate coherent two-paragraph articles on various topics
- Maintain consistent voice across different subjects
- Provide clean, usable interface
- Complete style analysis of all blog sections

### Long-term Success
- Reduce content creation time by 70%
- Generate content that requires minimal editing
- Create comprehensive, replicable style guide
- Build foundation for full automation system

## Next Steps
1. Confirm technical stack and deployment strategy
2. Begin style analysis of existing content
3. Design simple UI for topic input
4. Implement basic content generation
5. Create comprehensive style guide
6. Test and iterate on voice replication

## Resources Needed
- Access to Mark's blog content
