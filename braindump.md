# AI Agent Project - Brain Dump

## Project Overview
**AI Content Creation Agent System** - An automated system that creates blog post drafts and content summaries based on the user's writing style, with three specialized agents working together to process emails, track AI trends, and generate blog content.

## Initial Thoughts and Ideas
- **Core Concept**: AI agent system that learns user's writing style and automatically generates blog content
- **Primary Use Case**: Automate content creation for personal website (Jekyll-based at https://github.com/mark-torres10/personal_website)
- **Workflow**: Email processing → Content summarization → Blog post generation → PR creation
- **Style Learning**: Agent analyzes user's existing writing to understand tone, topics, and style patterns
- **Automation**: Daily runs to process new content and generate fresh blog posts

## Questions That Need Answers
1. **Style Analysis**: How many writing samples are needed for effective style learning?
2. **Email Processing**: What's the best way to authenticate with Gmail API securely?
3. **Content Sources**: Should we expand beyond Gmail to include RSS feeds, social media, etc.?
4. **Deployment**: What's the most cost-effective hosting solution for daily automation?
5. **PR Management**: How should we handle PR conflicts or merge issues?
6. **Content Quality**: What's the review/approval process for generated content?
7. **Rate Limits**: How do we handle API rate limits for Gmail, GitHub, and AI services?

## Potential Constraints and Requirements
- **Technical**: Must integrate with Gmail API, GitHub API, and AI services (Tavily, OpenAI)
- **Security**: Secure handling of Gmail credentials and API keys
- **Performance**: Daily automation with reasonable processing times
- **Cost**: Minimize API costs for AI services and hosting
- **Reliability**: Handle failures gracefully and provide monitoring
- **Compliance**: Ensure proper data handling and privacy

## Existing Context
- **Personal Website**: Jekyll-based site at https://github.com/mark-torres10/personal_website
- **Writing Style**: Need to analyze existing blog posts and research papers
- **Email Workflow**: Gmail account (mtorres.sandbox@gmail.com) for content intake
- **Content Types**: Research, tech, and personal writing styles to learn
- **Deployment Preference**: Minimal stack for speed (following rapid prototyper guidelines)

## Knowledge Gaps
- **Gmail API Integration**: Need to research authentication and email processing
- **GitHub API**: PR creation and management automation
- **AI Service Integration**: Best practices for Tavily and OpenAI integration
- **Style Learning**: Effective prompts and techniques for writing style analysis
- **Deployment Architecture**: Optimal hosting solution for daily automation

## Initial Scope Ideas
**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- Style learning from existing writing samples
- Gmail "READ THIS" email processing
- Basic summary document generation
- GitHub PR creation for summaries

**Phase 2 (Enhanced)**:
- AI trends monitoring via Tavily
- Blog post draft generation
- Automated PR creation for blog posts

**Phase 3 (Advanced)**:
- Multi-source content aggregation
- Advanced style learning and adaptation
- Content scheduling and publishing automation

## Risks and Concerns
- **API Reliability**: Gmail, GitHub, and AI services could have outages
- **Content Quality**: Generated content might not match user's style initially
- **Security**: Handling sensitive email data and API credentials
- **Cost Management**: AI API costs could escalate with daily usage
- **Maintenance**: Keeping the system running and updated
- **Content Duplication**: Avoiding duplicate blog posts or summaries
