# AI Content Creation Agent System - Specification

## 1. Problem Definition and Stakeholder Identification

### Problem Statement
Mark Torres needs an automated system to generate blog post drafts and content summaries that match his writing style, reducing the time spent on content creation while maintaining quality and authenticity. Currently, he manually processes interesting content from emails and web sources, which is time-consuming and inconsistent.

### Primary Stakeholder
- **Mark Torres**: Content creator and website owner who will review, edit, and approve generated content

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Website Readers**: Will consume the generated blog content
- **Content Sources**: Email senders and website authors whose content gets summarized

## 2. Success Metrics and Validation Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Content Quality**: Generated content passes Mark's review with minimal edits (<30% change rate)
- **Style Consistency**: Generated content matches Mark's writing style across different topics
- **Automation Reliability**: System runs daily without manual intervention (99% uptime)
- **Time Savings**: Reduces content creation time by 70% compared to manual process

### Validation Criteria
- **Style Learning**: Agent accurately identifies and replicates Mark's writing patterns
- **Content Relevance**: Summaries capture key insights and maintain source accuracy
- **PR Quality**: Generated PRs are properly formatted and ready for review
- **System Stability**: Handles API failures gracefully and provides error notifications

## 3. Scope Boundaries and Technical Requirements

### In Scope
- **Style Learning Agent**: One-time analysis of existing writing samples to understand Mark's style across different content types (research, tech, personal)
- **Email Processing Agent**: Monitors Gmail for "READ THIS" emails and processes text content only

- **Blog Post Agent**: Generates blog post drafts from processed content with titles and complete copy
- **PR Management**: Automated creation of GitHub PRs for both summaries and blog posts
- **Daily Automation**: Scheduled execution of all agents
- **Content Enhancement**: Integration with Tavily for additional context, images, and media

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- **Content Publishing**: Direct publishing to website (requires manual review)
- **Social Media Integration**: Cross-posting to social platforms
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed content performance tracking
- **Multi-language Support**: Content generation in languages other than English
- **Image Generation**: Creating custom images for blog posts
- **Paywall/Auth Handling**: Skip websites requiring authentication or paywalls
- **Email Attachments**: Process only text content from emails

### Technical Requirements
- **Gmail API Integration**: Secure authentication and email processing (text only)
- **GitHub API Integration**: PR creation and management with email notifications
- **AI Service Integration**: OpenAI for content generation, Tavily for web search and media
- **Scheduled Execution**: Daily automation with error handling
- **Secure Credential Management**: Environment variables and secure storage
- **Basic Logging**: Standard deployment logs (Vercel/Railway)
- **Content Style**: Follow AI_NATURAL_VOICE.md guidelines for human-like writing

## 4. User Experience Considerations

### Content Creator Experience (Mark)
- **Review Process**: Clear, well-formatted PRs with descriptive titles and complete blog post copy

- **Maintenance**: Easy updates and configuration changes

## 5. Technical Feasibility and Estimation

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Python-based microservices with FastAPI
- **Scheduling**: GitHub Actions for daily automation
- **Storage**: GitHub repository for content and configuration
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation, Tavily for web search and media
- **APIs**: Gmail API, GitHub API, OpenAI API, Tavily API
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Railway (free tier preferred)

### Development Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Style learning agent and basic email processing
- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: AI trends monitoring and blog post generation
- **Phase 3 (Week 5-6)**: PR automation and deployment optimization

### Resource Requirements
- **Development Time**: 6 weeks for full implementation
- **Infrastructure**: Free tier hosting (Vercel/Railway + GitHub Actions)
- **API Costs**: ~$30-50/month for AI services (optimized usage)
- **Maintenance**: 1-2 hours/week for monitoring and improvements

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Reliability**: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- **Content Quality**: Start with conservative prompts and iterate based on feedback
- **Security**: Use environment variables and secure credential management
- **Cost Control**: Implement usage monitoring and rate limiting

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### MVP Approach
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with email processing and basic summaries
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Test with real content and refine prompts
3. **Scale Gradually**: Add AI trends and blog post generation
4. **Optimize Continuously**: Improve based on usage patterns and feedback

### Success Criteria for Each Phase
- **Phase 1**: Successfully process 5 "READ THIS" emails with quality summaries (500-1000 words)
- **Phase 2**: Generate 3 AI trend summaries that pass review with natural writing style
- **Phase 3**: Create 2 blog post drafts with titles and complete copy that require minimal editing

This specification provides a clear roadmap for building an AI agent system that will significantly enhance Mark's content creation workflow while maintaining the quality and authenticity of his personal brand.
