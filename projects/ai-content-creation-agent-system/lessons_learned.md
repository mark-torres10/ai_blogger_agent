# Lessons Learned - AI Content Creation Agent System

## Project Planning Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Two-ticket approach**: Breaking the MVP into foundation + content generation was effective for clear dependencies
- **Style analysis first**: Prioritizing style analysis before content generation ensures better voice replication
- **Vercel deployment**: Choosing Vercel for the MVP provides quick deployment and good developer experience

### Areas for Improvement
<!-- Document any areas that could be improved in future iterations -->

## Technical Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js + TypeScript**: Good choice for rapid development and type safety
- **OpenAI API**: Appropriate for content generation with style replication
- **Sequential execution**: Required due to style guide dependency
