### Representative Excerpts
> "People, I think, unfairly downplay people's accomplishments because of privilege. Of course, privilege makes life much easier and opens up opportunities. Having money, for example, affords a child a better education, more tutoring, and other resources to make the odds that they do well in school higher. But, they still have to open the books and take the exams."

> "The books won't open themselves. The weights won't lift themselves. The books won't write themselves. Your kids won't raise themselves. No amount of money will ever change that, even if having money makes it easier to do these things."
