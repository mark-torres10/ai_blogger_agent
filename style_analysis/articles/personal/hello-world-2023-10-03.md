## Representative Excerpts

**Personal Reflection:**
> "I feel, in many ways, like a beginner once more. It's simultaneously a humbling and an exciting experience. On one hand, I think, 'I've been a professional engineer for 3 years now, why can't I center a div?', but at the same time, when something works I think 'oh look at me, I made that pretty button'."

**Cultural Observation:**
> "One of the quirks of being Filipino-American is that when you're in America, people tell you you're really Asian and they ask you 'where are you from? No, really?', while in the Philippines, people tell you 'oh you're so American' and 'why don't you speak Tagalog?'"

**Humorous Self-Deprecation:**
> "Can't even recognize myself in the mirror, my beautiful dashing radiant reflection oh you handsome little devil."

**Philosophical Reflection:**
> "Why is it that when we were kids, we found an excuse to laugh and smile at the stupidest things, but as we grow up, we think that 'growing up' means being more bummed out about life."
