## Representative Excerpts

**Problem Statement:**
> "Currently, as part of my research, I am investigating the possibility of manipulating people's social media algorithms and measuring their perceptions of political events around them."

**Technical Exploration:**
> "When starting this problem, I wanted to figure out what the end result would be and then to work backwards from there."

**Learning Insight:**
> "Lessons: Use an official, maintained version of a package, if available. If an API is brand-new, use the SDK that is most actively supported by the core developers."

**Self-Deprecating Humor:**
> "This may be an obvious point, but I can't host my server with localhost and expect Bluesky to be able to read it. Good job past Mark."
