## Representative Excerpts

**Problem Statement:**
> "I'm working on a project that involves gathering social media posts from Bluesky and analyzing them. Part of that project requires knowing which posts are about political or social topics, and if so, what political side they support."

**Methodological Approach:**
> "At first, I tried the naive, obvious approach, which is to just take the raw text of the post and ask the LLM to classify it."

**Results Summary:**
> "We already get pretty good performance with zero-shot models, and excellent performance for SOTA models. Adding context improves performance, especially as the models get larger."

**Future Direction:**
> "Now that we have something that works, the next step is to replicate the results of this pilot with a larger set of data as well as make any improvements that I observed from doing the testing."
